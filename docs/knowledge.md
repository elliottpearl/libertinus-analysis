# Knowledge
This project studies combining mark behavior of Libertinus fonts.

## Background
The Libertinus fonts are used by the publisher Language Science Press (LangSci) in XeLaTeX projects to produce books. The subject matter is linguistics and language science, which requires combining diacritical marks in custom notation beyond that expected in other subjects or even usually supported by some fonts. Regrettably, Libertinus has weak support for some bases and combining marks.
